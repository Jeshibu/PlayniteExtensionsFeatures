* You will still need the original game clients like Steam or Ubisoft Connect or EA.
* Playnite does not make any games available for free, nor does it support piracy.
* The console library extensions (Nintendo, Playstation) do not enable you to play their games on PC. These are here solely for organization and management. The exception is Xbox, which while it does not enable you to play Xbox-console only games, does have many games available for PC.

[Library plugin metadata](./librarymetadata.md)

[Install these plugins here](https://playnite.link/addons.html)

[^a]: Reads local client files. Requires you to start up the client to add new games.
[^c]: Manual installation only: you are pointed to a download URL and can link the game to an installation folder once you've installed it.
[^d]: Only the games downloadable from the website (so excluding keys for Steam or other services)
[^h]: Play time is always tracked when launched through Playnite
[^i]: Not strictly speaking installed, but playable via streaming
[^j]: Only games that were purchased, as there is no ownership for free games. But games followed on Game Jolt can be treated as owned if enabled in settings.
[^k]: Playtime available only for PS4 and PS5 games
[^l]: Minecraft instance importer
[^m]: Makes using the original client unnecessary
[^n]: Local or network drive game installer manager
